# data-analysis

## Opening the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
You need to install several Python packages to use the jupyter notebook.
```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install --upgrade ipython jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib
```

After those commands complete, `cd` into the data-analysis repo and type `jupyter notebook`. The directory should open in your browser and then you can open the notebook by simply clicking on the file name.
